FactoringCalculator
===================
This is a small project that I have been working on to help me in math class (Algebra II)
The takes an equation and factors it, solves it, or graphs it.
It is very self explanatory and easy to use

Anyone may use it and view the source code as long as they do not claim it as their own.
